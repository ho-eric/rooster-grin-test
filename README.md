# Getting Started

Check out a live demo [here](https://rooster-grin-test-demo.netlify.app/).

## What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

I used the React library and the Sass preprocessor to develop my frontend and the Sanity CMS for my backend. I chose to use these technologies because React makes it more straightforward to develop front ends and Sanity enables you to dynamically and easily update content on the website as needed.

## Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
I faced a bit of difficulty initially setting up Sanity to integrate with the website. Once I read through the documentation and did some searching, it was fairly simple to use. I also faced a little bit of trouble aligning everything properly in the mobile view with flex, but I was able to solve those problems using the chrome inspector tool and a bit of googling.

## What you enjoyed the most and why
What I enjoyed the most was the exercise of putting everything together and making sure all of the details were as close to perfect as possible. It is really satisfying to me when you go through the whole process of an initial mockup to the finished product.
